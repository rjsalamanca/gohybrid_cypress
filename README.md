# GoHybrid With Cypress Testing

GoHybrid is indended for car consumers looking to purchase hybrid vehicles and comparing hybrid models to their gas counter parts. Using an external Government run vehicle API, this application gets details about various cars. Using that information, GoHybrid calculates how much money you would save by purchasing the hybrid model versus the gas model. If you have multiple cars you like, you can log in and save comparisons!

This application is created with a ***PERN*** stack. (postgreSQL, Express, React, and Node).
